F1TENTH Gym Documentation 
================================================

Overview
---------
The F1TENTH Gym environment is created for research that needs a asynchronous, realistic vehicle simulation with multiple vehicle instances in the same environment, with applications in reinforcement learning.

The environment is designed with determinism in mind. All agents' physics simulation are stepped simultaneously, and all randomness are seeded and experiments can be reproduced. The explicit stepping also enables the physics engine to take advantage of faster than real-time execution (up to 30x realtime) and enable massively parallel applications.

Example Usecases
------------------

1. The gym environment is used as the backend for the F1TENTH virtual racing online competition at IROS 2020:
